Welcome to my super cluster fuck of c++.
I love c++! It is my favourite language for software development, game development, and data structures and algorithms.

The purpose of this repo is to technically apply the concept of data structures and algorithms using c++.

The heck is data structures and algorithms?

Data structures is a computer science concept of Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms that work together. Containers are data structures that provide you a way (such as vectors) to store data. Iterators are objects that allow you to access elements of a container (such as a for loop iterator), and algorithms include functions that preform operations on containers through iterators. In order to master searching and manipulating data structures efficiently, you must master data structures with algorithms as they rely on each other. 

You don't need to be a computer programmer to be interested in this stuff. It is super fun to solve data structures and algorithms whether as a challenge or a casual puzzle, and I would encourage anyone to try if they want to exercise their brains.

Anyway I will clean this up some time soon.
